## Introduction

Sharing recipes online is tedious, and often involves a lot more than just writing the recipe - such as preparing a detailed ingredient list, writing an introduction, taking an appetising picture and a lot more.

NinjaChefs + AI, attempts to eliminate this 'barrier to entry' from online recipe sharing and make it accessible by helping the user focus on just the recipe.
